# 🛑 LEGAL NOTICE (DISCLAIMER)

## 1. Purpose and Sources of the List

This user list is a dynamic compilation of Twitch platform usernames identified with patterns of **"follow fake"**, spam, advertising bots, *hate raid* attacks, or other malicious behavior that violates community guidelines. Its sole purpose is the protection and improvement of the moderation of associated channels.

The compilation is made from a variety of sources, including:

* **Public Community Blocklists:** Open projects and shared databases.

* **Advanced Moderation Systems:** Data generated by bots known as **sery_bot** and **CommanderRoot** (specifically from sources such as `twitch-tools.rootonline.de`).

* **Community Repositories:** Contributions from public projects.

* **Internal and Private Lists:** Usernames shared privately among our network of streamers and moderation staff.

## 2. Risk of Inaccuracy and Disclaimer

**RISK OF FALSE POSITIVES:** Given the nature of compiling from multiple sources (some automated and external), there is an inherent risk that **legitimate users**, real bots that help the community (e.g., command or game bots), or even moderators may be incorrectly included and sanctioned (**False Positive**).

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK:** By accessing this list for integration via third-party APIs (Sammy, StreamElements, CommanderRoot, etc.), **you assume full responsibility** for any sanction action (ban or timeout) resulting from the automated consumption of this data. **[EL BUHO 89 . ORG SAS and its maintainers assume no responsibility for any damages, errors, or losses caused by the application of this list. Verification and use with caution are recommended.

Specifically, within the framework of **Law 1581 of 2012 (Personal Data Protection)**, it is declared that the data contained herein is **public** (usernames from public platforms such as Twitch), is collected for a legitimate purpose (security and moderation), and its processing is strictly limited to said purpose.

Any request for correction or deletion related to personal data will be handled in accordance with current regulations.

## 4. Correction and Support Requests

If a username was added or removed in error, or if you have information that justifies a change to the list, we kindly ask that you **submit a Support Ticket (Issue)** in our GitHub repository.
